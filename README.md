_\* WIP - Work In Progress_

## Some background of me?

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

Alright here we go:

- First programming language that I learn is javascript when I was in primary-secondary school [iirc](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/iirc#:~:text=IIRC%20is%20an%20internet%20abbreviation,not%20be%20100%25%20sure%20of.). That time I just get access to Internet so I stumble scross [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) where I started learning math and programming. I didn't manage to finish the whole course because it's boring hahahah
- In form 4, when I in MRSM, we have subject called Computer Science iirc. We learn on Visual Basic .NET. Subjek paling favourite tapi kelas seminggu sekali je, pastu kdg2 cikgu tk masuk arghdgh. Lps tu cikgu ganti amik alih. Lagi pishangg hahaa.
- In CFS / Asasi IIUM, we learn C. Then, in first year degree we learn C++. Dua2 ni menarik and markah alhamdulillah gempak hhaha
- My first app was [Malaysian WhatsApp Sticker packs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sticker.WAMalaysianStickers).Urm, why that app? At that time, I have 0 knowledge of Android (native) app development. Still, WhatsApp has its official [source code](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers), so I yoink the code, replaces all assets, and boom. Yea, that my first baby step in development.
- I am also starting Unity game development after watching [Dani's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPmD9I2b7L8). I feel like, "Waa, that's cool." And yea, I found many tutorials online that keep boosting my motivation into development. I released quite a few apps with Unity (yea, apps, not games, hehe). The sad part is now I'm stopped developing with Unity. Perhaps one day I'll come back, who knows.
- Ok far, I developed most of my apps in Flutter. So, why I choose [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)? Tbh idk. Perhaps Flutter community in growing fast. Peoples start using it so why don't I try it, right? Things Flutter can do over native is ability to publish app for multiple platforms, eg: Android, Web and Desktop. I consider Flutter and Dart is quite easy to learmn and it is definitely suitable for beginner.
- I wouldn't say I liked web development that much; to be honest, it is somewhat dull and hard to learn for me. Nah, I'm unsure about it. It has a wide-range to tech stack used right now (Tailwinds, bootstrap, vue bla bla). Right now I'm following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3) on React.
- So what next? Currently busy in doing assignments/homeworks üòÖ
